# 👋 Hi, I’m Chinmay Dali

I'm a software engineer with a passion for building **scalable microservices**, **real-time systems**, and **developer-focused tools**. With a Master's in Computer Science from **Stevens Institute of Technology**, I specialize in both **backend** and **full-stack** engineering—recently expanding my interest toward **compiler design and optimization**.

- 💼 Currently @ **Corebridge Financial** — building high-performance B2B microservices.
- 📍 Previously @ **LTI-Mindtree** — worked on cloud-native analytics dashboards and ETL pipelines.
- 🔬 Now diving deeper into **compilers**, **PL theory**, and systems programming research.
